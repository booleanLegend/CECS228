    "Write a function `order(words)` which takes in the *set* of strings `words` and returns a *list* of strings ordered in alphabetical order (lexicographic order).  To do so, you must take the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For each word $l_1l_2\\cdots l_n$ in the set, convert each letter $l_i$ into its unicode representation $u_i$ (look into the built-in function `ord()`).\n",
    "2. Create an $n$-tuple for each word using the unicode representations: $l_1l_2\\cdots l_n  \\rightarrow (u_1, u_2, \\dots, u_n)$.\n",
    "3. Compare the $n$-tuples using the lexicographic ordering  $(u_1, u_2, \\dots, u_n) \\preceq (v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_m)$  if at least one of the following is true:\n",
    " * $u_1 < v_1$   \n",

    " * $u_i = v_i$ for $i = 1, 2, \\dots, k$ AND  $u_{k+1} < v_{k+1}$  where $k+1 < n, m$\n",

    " OR\n",
    " \n",
    " * $u_i = v_i$ for $i = 1, 2, \\dots n$  AND $n < m$\n",
    "4. Order the tuples according to the comparisons carried out in step 3.\n",
    "5. Convert each tuple back to letters and concatenate to form a word (look into the built-in function `chr()`).\n",
    "6. Store the result in to a list and return the list."
